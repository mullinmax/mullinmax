# Who am I?
I'm a hobbyist and a tinkerer. I do lots of small projects; in mostly python to realx after my Day job is at [84.51Â°](https://8451.com) where I am a senior data scientist.
Sometimes I get an idea about a novel way to do something that isn't relevant enough to my job to spend time on. Mostly those ideas end up in a repository here. 

I'm particularly interested in automation and simple compilers. Most of what I do is playing with ideas around playing with data with one or both of those. As of writing this I'm most focused on H2H (ping me with a better name please)
