I'm a **Data Engineer** with a strong background in **Python, SQL, and cloud infrastructure**. When I'm not working with big data, you'll find me experimenting with:
🕹️ Embedded systems programming for pinball machines
🌍 Self-hostable web apps & backend engineering
🧠 Leveraging LLMs for practical (and silly) applications
🎭 Hacky toy projects & creative ideas

🚀 I'm currently **looking for a new role**! If you think I'd be a great fit for your team, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-mullin-413070b4).

# 🔧 Cool Projects

🎰 **[Warped Pinball - Vector](https://github.com/warped-pinball/vector)**
  
  A **modern software platform for '80s pinball machines**, enabling WiFi, leaderboards, and expanded functionality using **MicroPython** and **embedded hardware**. Runs on a low-power processor with just **200KB of RAM**, making every byte count.

🐊 **[Aggy](https://github.com/mullinmax/aggy)**
  
  A **self-hostable personalized content aggregator**, helping users find relevant content using only their own data. This project is far from complete as the front end is still under development. But the live backend server's docs page can be found [here](https://api.aggy.io/docs)

💡 **[Connections Solver](https://github.com/mullinmax/connections)**
  
  Proof of consept script to see if LLMs can solve the NYT conncetions puzzles using embeddings. It works, just not well enough to invest time into it. I'm hoping for more powerful self hostable models to be released in order to make this more of a reality.

🔄 **[Flip-Flop](https://github.com/mullinmax/flip-flop)**
  
  A simple page swapper dashbaord driven by docker labels to bring all your self hosted web UIs into one place. See the demo instance here: [https://flip-flop-demo.doze.dev/](https://flip-flop-demo.doze.dev/)

# 📢 Writing & Speaking
