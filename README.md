# Who am I?
By day I work as a Data Enginner at [84.51Â°](https://www.8451.com/).
By night I develop self-hostable applications and scripts to help me maintain them.
Sometimes I get an idea about a novel way to do something that isn't relevant enough to my job to spend time on. Mostly those ideas end up in a repository here. 
I'm particularly interested in automation, LLMs, and simple compilers but my code ranges all over.

Check out [my blog](https://blog.doze.dev) to see what I'm currently thinking about.
