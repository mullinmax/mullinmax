# Who am I?
I'm a hobbyist and a tinkerer. I do lots of small projects; in mostly python to realx after my Day job is at [84.51Â°](https://www.8451.com/) where I am a Data Engineer.
Sometimes I get an idea about a novel way to do something that isn't relevant enough to my job to spend time on. Mostly those ideas end up in a repository here. 

I'm particularly interested in automation, LLMs, and simple compilers. Most of what I do is playing with ideas around playing with data with one of those areas. As of writing this I'm most focused on Pluvial which is a markdown based static site generator. (because the world needs more of those)
